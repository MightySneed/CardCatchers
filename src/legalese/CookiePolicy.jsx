            <h2>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gif"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the ebsite from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2>
            <p>Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSQs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.</p>
            <p>If you do not want Flas Cokies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Gloal Storage Settings Panel ad following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete exising Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSQs from eing placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</p>
            <p>Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash aplications, including, potntially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.</p>
